efficient, reliable, and user-friendly environment for
uploading, viewing, downloading, and managing files in a
cloud-based system.
 At the beginning of the demo, the user is
directed to the Login and Registration page. This module
ensures that only authorized users can access the
application. New users can register by entering their name,
email, and password, while existing users can log in using
valid credentials. The authentication process is implemented
using JWT (JSON Web Token), ensuring that all user
sessions are verified and secure. Once logged in
successfully, the user is redirected to the dashboard, which
acts as the central workspace of the system.
 The dashboard interface is designed with
simplicity and ease of use in mind. It contains clear options
to upload files, view previously uploaded files, and manage
user data. The layout is responsive, providing a smooth
experience across desktop and mobile devices. The frontend
is built using React.js / HTML / CSS, which gives a clean and
dynamic user interface for easy interaction.
 During the demo, the user clicks on the Upload
File button. A file selector opens, allowing the user to choose
any file type, such as images, PDFs, or text documents.
Once the user selects a file, it is uploaded to the backend
through a RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.js.
The backend processes the file, validates it (checking for
size limits and allowed formats), and then stores it securely
in the MongoDB database using GridFS,a powerful file
storage system designed to handle large files efficiently.
 Once the upload is complete, the system displays
a confirmation message and refreshes the file list
automatically. The user can now view the newly uploaded
file along with its details, such as file name, type, size, and
upload date. The files are displayed in a structured table
format, making it easy to identify and manage them.
 The system also allows users to download or
delete any uploaded file with a single click. When the user
chooses to download a file, the system fetches it securely
from the database and delivers it directly to the user’s
device. When deleting a file, the backend verifies user
permissions before permanently removing it from the
database. These actions demonstrate the system’s strong
data validation, error handling, and access control
mechanisms.
 The admin module is also presented during the
final demo. The admin has extended privileges to view all
user activities, monitor uploaded files, manage storage, and
remove unnecessary data. This ensures efficient use of
server resources and maintains overall system performance.
The admin dashboard is designed to help administrators
maintain control and ensure smooth operations.
 Throughout the demonstration, special emphasis is
placed on security and performance. The project uses
authentication tokens, encrypted communication, and
backend validation to prevent unauthorized access and data
corruption. The use of Node.js ensures fast API responses,
while MongoDB provides a scalable and flexible data
management solution.
 The user interface (UI) has been designed to be
intuitive, visually clean, and easy to navigate. The frontend
communicates seamlessly with the backend through REST
APIs, making all operations fast and reliable. The use of
asynchronous functions and error-handling middleware
further improves the system’s efficiency and stability.
 At the end of the demo, the user logs out of the
application,and the system safely ends the session by
invalidating the authentication token. This ensures that the
user’s account remains secure even after logout.
 Overall, the final demo successfully proves the
complete functionality of the project. It shows that the
system can:
 Authenticate users securely
 Upload files of different types and sizes
 Display and manage uploaded files
 Provide options for downloading and
deleting
 Support both user and admin roles
 Ensure security, reliability, and user
satisfaction
 The demonstration concludes by emphasizing
how the IBM-NJ-FILE UPLOAD MANAGER effectively solves
the challenges of manual file handling. It provides a
centralized, cloud-based, and secure platform for file
management that is suitable for personal, academic, and
enterprise use. The system’s performance, accuracy, and
smooth workflow make it a reliable tool for modern digital
environments
 2.PROJECT REPORT :

 Abstract
 The IBM-NJ-File Upload Manager is a secure webbased system designed to allow users to upload, manage, and
retrieve files efficiently. It provides a simple interface for
authenticated users to store files safely in the cloud. The project
focuses on reliability, security, and scalability using Node.js,
Express, and MongoDB. It simplifies digital file handling by
providing centralized storage, automated upload management, and
easy file retrieval through a web interface.
 Objective
 The main objective of this project is to create a secure and
user-friendly application that allows users to:
 Upload different types of files (images, PDFs, documents, etc.).
 Store uploaded files securely in a database or cloud
environment.
 View, download, and delete files easily through a web
dashboard.
 Provide admin control for monitoring and managing uploads.
 Ensure data integrity, scalability, and security during file
operations.
 Existing System
 In the existing manual or traditional systems, file sharing
and storage are mostly handled through email, USB drives, or thirdparty services. These methods are inefficient and unsafe as they
often lead to data loss, duplication, or unauthorized access. There
is no centralized control for managing files, and retrieving data
becomes difficult over time. Moreover, users cannot easily track
upload history or manage storage space effectively.
 Proposed System
 The proposed system provides a
centralized and automated platform for managing files. It enables
users to securely upload, view, and manage their files using a web
interface. Authentication ensures that only valid users can access
the system. The backend uses Node.js and MongoDB to provide a
scalable and secure environment. The application allows both users
and administrators to efficiently control data and storage,
eliminating the drawbacks of manual file handling.
 System Design Modules
1. User Authentication Module – Handles user registration,
login, and session management using JWT tokens.
2. File Upload Module – Enables users to upload files securely
with size and type validation.
3. File Management Module – Displays all uploaded files with
options to view, download, or delete them.
4.Admin Module – Allows administrators to monitor user
activity and manage uploaded files.
5.Database Management Module – Uses MongoDB and
GridFS for storing large files efficientl
 Architecture
The system follows a three-tier architecture:
 Presentation Layer (Frontend) – Developed using HTML,
CSS, and React.js for an interactive user experience.
 Application Layer (Backend) – Built with Node.js and
Express.js to handle API requests, file uploads, and user
authentication.
 Database Layer – Implemented using MongoDB, which
stores file data, metadata, and user details.
Data flow begins from the user interface, passes through the
backend APIs for validation, and is stored securely in the database.
